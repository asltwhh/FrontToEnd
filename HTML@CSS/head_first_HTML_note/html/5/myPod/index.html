		<h1>Welcome to myPod</h1>
		<p>
		Welcome to the place to show off your iPod, 
		wherever you might be. Wanna join the fun? 
		All you need is any iPod, from the early classic 
		iPod to the latest iPod Nano, the smallest iPod 
		Shuffle to the largest iPod Photo, and a digital camera. 
		Just take a snapshot of your iPod in your favorite 
		location and we'll be glad to post it on myPod. So, 
		what are you waiting for?
